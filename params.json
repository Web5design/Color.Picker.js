{"name":"Color-picker","body":"Color Picker: Classic\r\n----------------------\r\nThe latest rendition of the Color Picker “Classic”, themed after Photoshop, GIMP, and other image editors—there are no frills here, it’s a basic Hue, Saturation, Value, and Alpha (HSVA) color selector. \r\n\r\nColor Picker: HSL + RGBA\r\n-------------------------\r\nThis color picker allows you to create colors with fine detail. \r\nYou can actually see the changes in <canvas> as you adjust the Hue, Saturation, Value along with the Red, Green, and Blue values. \r\n\r\nColor Picker: Sphere\r\n---------------------\r\nThe main benefit of the Color Sphere over the traditional Color Picker is it’s size, it barely takes up any pixel space at all.  Need more precision? You can resize it!","tagline":"Color Pickers in HTML5 :)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
